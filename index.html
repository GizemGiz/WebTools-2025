    <h1>Hello Code World!</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I’m Gizem, an aspiring software developer with a passion for technology and problem-solving. 
        Six years ago, I took a big step and moved here, embracing the challenge of learning English while building a new life.
        Changing careers was a bold decision, especially in a field that isn’t in my native language, but I’ve always believed in pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.
        My journey started in QA testing, where I developed skills in analyzing systems, testing applications, and ensuring software quality.
        Now, I’m expanding my expertise in MySQL, CompTIA A+, and programming to build a strong foundation in software development.

        <p>Beyond tech, I love staying active and enjoying the outdoors. 
            Tennis and volleyball are my favorite sports—I play them whenever I can, watch games on TV, and even attend live volleyball matches.
            Walking by the lake is one of my favorite ways to unwind, and I also enjoy drawing when inspiration strikes.
            Life can be busy, but I always make time for the things that bring me joy.
        I’m married and share my home with my beloved 2-year-old cat, who keeps life fun and entertaining. 
        My biggest goals are to become a highly skilled developer, achieve financial success, and create a happy, fulfilling future for my family. 
        The journey hasn’t been easy, but I believe that with dedication and perseverance, anything is possible. 
        Thanks for visiting my page—I’m excited to share my story with you! </p>
