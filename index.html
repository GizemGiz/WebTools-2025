            <p>Hi, my name is Gizem. I am from Cappadocia, which mean is Land of Beatiful Horses.
                I am currently pursuing an Associate of Science in Software Development, 
                driven by my passion for technology and problem-solving. 
                My goal is to become a skilled software developer who can contribute to innovative and impactful projects. 
                I am highly motivated to build a strong foundation in programming, 
                database management, and system design, as I believe these are essential skills for a successful career in software development.

            <p> I have taken courses such as MySQL, 
                which helps me understand database management and data structures, 
                as well as CompTIA A+, which provides a strong foundation in IT fundamentals, hardware, and networking.
                Additionally, I have studied web design tools and English composition to enhance both my technical and communication skills. 
                These courses are crucial for my academic and professional growth, 
               as they equip me with the knowledge needed to succeed in the tech industry.
            </p>

            <h3 id="reason-for-taking-class">REASON FOR TAKING THIS CLASS</h3>
            <p>I'm taking Web Design Tools because I want to build a strong foundation in front-end development. 
                Since I'm working toward becoming a software developer, 
                I know that understanding how websites and applications are structured, styled, and made interactive is essential.
                This course will help me learn key design principles, layout techniques, and tools like HTML and CSS, 
                which will be valuable when developing user-friendly applications.
                Previously, I pursued a path as a QA tester, where I gained hands-on experience in testing applications,
                analyzing product requirements, and identifying software issues. While I enjoyed working in QA,
                I realized that I wanted to have a more direct role in building and shaping applications rather than just testing them.
                The problem-solving aspect of development and the ability to create functional,
                interactive software from scratch drew me toward software engineering.
                I also see this course as an opportunity to complement my other coursework,
                like MySQL and CompTIA A+, by gaining a better understanding of how the front end interacts with back-end systems. 
                Having a well-rounded skill set will not only make me a more capable developer but also give me more flexibility in my career.</p>

            <h3 id="personal-hobbies">PERSONAL HOBBIES</h3>
            
        <p>Beyond academics, I have a variety of interests that keep me balanced.
            I enjoy drawing, as it allows me to express creativity and take a break from the technical world.
            I also love staying active through volleyball, tennis, and swimming, which help me maintain a healthy lifestyle.
            One of my must go is to go US Open.
            I have a deep appreciation for the sea speacially Mediternean sea mostly or and find being near the water lake or sea both calming and inspiring.
            My favorite place is Oludeniz, Mugla/Turkiye. Also I love travelling. Always want to see new places, new cultures or even a new restuarant or cafee shops. 
            Discovering new places are always best feeling.
            Additionally, I sometimes like cooking and experimenting with different recipes, particularly Turkish cuisine,
            as it allows me to explore flavors and connect with my cultural roots. PS: If you're in IT, I highly recommend watching Silicon Valleyâ€”it's a must-see!</p>
